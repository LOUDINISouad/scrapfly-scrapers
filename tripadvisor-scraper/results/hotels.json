      "text": "Visited hotel 1926 for our anniversary weekend. On arrival the hotel appeared tucked away however the view fromOur room 919 was beautiful. This hotel has every modernity I had never even contemplated - digital door pads, tablet in room for extra requests and information. The bathroom is massive although be warned a towel on the floor after showering is a must! I had both a eyebrow treatment and my husband and I had a couples massage and full use of the spa- beautiful beautiful hydro pool, sauna, steam room and heated loungers. Whilst the prices of the treatments may seem pricey they are worth above and beyond what we paid and were extremely good (if not the best we have ever had). The hotel was spotlessly cleanHowever if you run out of teabags fine housekeeping and don‚Äôt ask at the bar otherwise they will charge you 2 euros a tea bag üôàThe customer service within the hotel was beyond reproach - no request was too big and we were always greeted with familiarity and smiles. Even being offered croissants and drinks at 4am whilst waiting for our taxi on the day of departure was a beautiful touch and much appreciated. Overall small things that didn‚Äôt quite get a 5* however if I could give a 4.75 then I would be! Highly recommend Hotel 1926 and will be suggesting to friends and family to book here in the future as well as booking to return in the future for ourselves",

There are very very polite, friendly and helpful. I loved the fact that the hotel is a green hotel and they care very much about the environment. You will find organic bathroom amenities and other little stuff to make your stay comfortable. The breakfast was amazing, wide selection of choices, fresh and deliciously made. Their beach club is something you definitely need to visit. That one the selling point for me, while booking my stay. The location is right in the heart of Sliema, you have a Point shopping mall just few steps away and a lot of other shops, supermarkets and restaurants around. The room walls were a bit thin so you might hear your neighbours late arrival but it did not make my stay less comfortable. My stay highly exceeded my expectations. Definitely will stay again while visiting Malta. Thank you 1926 hotel for making my stay very comfortable.",

      "title": "Good location and beach club",
      "text": "Hotel 1926 offers a great location far enough away from the hustle of the busy streets but remains close enough for easy access by a few minutes walk. The beach club was the highlight for our stay with amazing views and great food at the restaurant there. We had a free room upgrade so I can‚Äôt speak on price for what you get, but the room was clean and simple, not a bad thing. Also the rooms come with universal plugs which is a big positive which we didn‚Äôt know of!Unfortunately the water pressure in our room was terrible at all times of the day as well as the temperature not maintaining. The elevator. There were 2 however, they were horrendously slow and often missed your floor even though it was requested. This made it frustrating, especially if you‚Äôre on a higher floor. We often found ourselves taking the stairs after waiting 3-4 minutes. The concierge had great recommendations for food, it would have been nice if they offered to make a reservation when they make these suggestions. Other times, it was very hit and miss with who was working at reception as to if your request was met or not. Our checkout was a nightmare as we left our bags with them and were told we could shower in the spa when leaving and they would hold our bags until needed. When this time came, it took 30 minutes for them to retrieve our bags and multiple requests asking where they were and what was taking so long. Finally, I think to say this is a spa hotel is a stretch unfortunately... the massages were overpriced for what they were, I‚Äôve had better from the cheap Thai massage shops at a third of the price. The spa facilities themselves were very underwhelming with a small ‚Äúmassage pool‚Äù, sauna and non functioning steam room.Overall, we enjoyed our stay but I believe this was because we utilised the beach club which was great and often spent our days out so for location and the beach club, amazing. Otherwise, not greatly impressed.",

      "title": "Really disappointed with the pool access ",
      "text": "I stayed at the 1926 hotel for a week with my friend on a girlie trip. We booked the hotel as we like to lounge and sunbathe by the pool all day before exploring different places in the evening. I messaged the beach club before we booked checking that hotel guests had free access to the club and they assured me they did. When we arrived to check in the process was really easy and the hotel staff were polite, kind and friendly. We had been upgraded to a bigger room which was laid out lovely. It was modern with everything we needed. The issues comes with the access to the beach club. We were told on check in that we could either use the pool 9.30am-1 .30 or 2-6.30pm the reason it was these times was so the beds could be sanitised. We were really unhappy with not having access to the pool for the whole day, so on the first day they gave us a full day wrist band. At no point were the beds sanitised or wiped and it was clear that alot of people were paying to use the facilities, which seemed so annoying. That night I spoke to the manager who said that it wasnt to sanitise the beds but because people were reserving beds and not using them that they had set times. I explained that nowhere did it state this before we booked the hotel and he just shrugged.He agreed that we could use the pool all day the following day but not over the weekend as they were really busy. He assured me noone other than hotel guests were allowed to pay to use the pool at this time due to the restrictions. This simply wasn't true. We were asked to vacate our sunbeds at 1.30pm on one of the days, but told we could still use the pool (just not a sunbed) which was really embarassing, moving out stuff to the side of the pool, so we sat in the pool and watched while noone else despite them being the same colour wristbands as us were asked to move. We spoke to the manager AGAIN who gave us day passes for the final 2 days of our stay. I guess for some this isn't an issue, but for us we chose this hotel as it looked like the best place we could sunbathe, relax and enjoy the sea view.The view from the pool and the pool itsself was GORGEOUS and I completely understand the concept of what the hotel is trying to create with the beach club. However, in this circumstance, hotel guests should come first and unfortunately this wasn't and certainly didn't feel the case.",

      "text": "Great room, although I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the standard and the superior rooms. I booked superior but from the floor plan I was in the smallest room. Very clean and modern (big plus). There‚Äôs a small fridge in the room. Slippers and robes supplied. Hotel situated in a great location, close to Valletta and the ferry. Not in St Julians which turned out to be the correct decision as it was quieter in Sliema. Spar and food stores close by. A nice touch was the little bag of dried flowers for me to take home. Nice memorable gift. You enter your room with a pin code so there‚Äôs no risk of forgetting your swipe card. Also, the wifi password could‚Äôve been printed on the room number card as opposed to handwritten on a sticky (while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that I feel sorry for the receptionist who has to write this down dozens of times everyday). I gave it four stars because I was initially lead to booking with this hotel because of the infinity pool shown on the booking.com website. Upon arrival I was told that the pool is closed for the season! Very disappointed. I feel that it should be mentioned more prominently regarding the operational dates. But their spa, sauna and steam room made up for that (almost). They were definitely fantastic. There was also construction drilling and hammering noise throughout the day - they say it‚Äôs the building next door but it sounds like it‚Äôs the next wall. The spa itself opens at 8 but the staff said 10 (which was the massage service part, so if you wanted to use just the spa you don‚Äôt need to wait until 10). Finally, a lot of hotels in Malta provide free breakfast and I feel that it should be included given the price. Even if it‚Äôs just the simple options and if you want something fancier you can order extra. Will stay again (when the outdoor pool is open).",

      "text": "Our 7 nights stay with friends at 1926 hotel was very good overall. The hotel is located near the beach boulevard and in my opinion Sliema is the best location to stay while in Malta. Although the area is quite quiet in general, apart some noise from the street on weekend, the hotel could improve soundproofing inside the hotel. When closing the hotel room door (room 611) we could see light coming from the corridor on the edge of the door. Also all the noises from the corridor could be heard very clearly in the room.1926 hotel is very clean and the rooms and public areas are comfortable. Mattress was too stiff for our liking but that is a matter of an opinion. The hair dryer in the room is totally useless, bring your own if you need to dry your hair! Beach Club, located maybe 200 meters from the hotel, was very nice with comfortable sun loungers, big umbrellas, beautiful pool and corgeous sea views. It was the beginning of the season so the services were some what limited, but will propably improve over summer. Hotel also has a spa with a swimming pool and saunas but we didn¬¥t use these facilities. I did see them when visiting the Spa for manicure (which I can totally recommend!) and the spa area also looks very nice.Service on the front desk could be better. Many times there was 4 or 5 persons on the desk but on some occasions none of them even greeted us when we entered the hotel. Service on the breakfast however was very good!Breakfast was ample and delicious. They even served freshly squeezed orange juice and Prosecco. Some problems with the coffee makers but we got our coffee every morning so not a huge problem. Breakfast staff was great! If you want to enjoy your breakfast in peace do go early. It gets busy at 9 AM.For transportation we recommend to use Franklin Garage. Professional and polite drivers, clean cars, easy to reach via Whatsapp, gets you where you want to go on time and with reasonable price.",

I highly recommend trying out the beach club restaurant for their sushi, it was delicious! The breakfast had many options to suit all tastebuds including full English options and continental breakfast. (Photos attached) The staff from housekeeping to restaurant and reception teams were all so friendly and helpful.

No key card for opening the doors was a plus. The breakfast was not really impressive, but there  are multiple cafes in a walking distance so we decided to have breakfasts outside the hotel. The  indoor Spa was also nice and relaxing.Just a few things to consider before booking: - I was hoping to get a room with a view, but  unfortunately, the hotel itself is not by the sea, (although the pictures may give such an impression) and  most of the rooms have windows to small alleys, and that was nothing that the staff could do.- In addition,  while booking, I found the infinity pool  really tempting, and we mainly chose the hotel for its nice infinity pool, but later we realized that the pool is closed during winter season because of the unpredictable weather.- The hotel doesnt have its own parking space, but we didnt find it difficult to find parking spots  closeby,  later in the evenings during holidays.But all in all, it was a nice stay, and I would recommend the hotel.",

You can still have breakfast until 12PM, even though it finishes at 11AM. The beach club and infinity pool is probably the best in Malta. You have to make sure you book it one day in advance.

It was nice to use the gym of the hotel even though it is just a small room mainly furnished with cardio machines, but I never found it crowded and thus used without any queues. The swimming pool and Spa facilities are well equipped and I very much enjoyed the massages offered, for sure an highlight of my experience in Malta.

Too bad there is no wine opener. The hotel itself is not very new, but quite well renovated and the rooms are well cleaned.

They are extremely accommodating and professional. The hotel should be very proud of having them as staff and I hope they are shown often that they are a real credit to the smooth running of the establishment! A special mention to Sohel who was absolutely great and also the lovely receptionist whom was on shift when we checked in on the evening of 20th July). The hotel itself is beautiful. Great decor and very ideally located! A stone throw from the beach, super markets, great restaurants and bars. But far enough that you aren‚Äôt right in the midst of party goers etc. The hotel itself has a great bar with a happy hour in the evenings. Breakfast (if you chose to have it included) was a great addition. Buffet style with lots of choice. We also attended the restaurant one evening for dinner and it was superb! The spa facilities are okay. (A nice addition to your stay) although the steam room wasn‚Äôt great and can get a little crowded! The rooms decor wise are fantastic. Great size, good facilities and the cleaning team are excellent and very on top of their job! You have molton brown products included alongside plenty of towels, bath robes, a hair dryer and also well working A/C. It would have been nice for water to be provided daily but only one bottle throughout the stay and this made the coffee machine provided pointless. Also note that there is a large gap under the doors and also extremely thin walls - it is very hard to actually sleep with an elevator right outside your bedroom door with people constantly coming and going alongside the sound of people dragging furniture throughout the night, and quite literally being able to hear the adjacent guest snoring the entire night. (Perhaps a draft excluder could be provided to block under the doors and ear plugs?) The hotel also offer free activities that you are able to book onto. Although we didn‚Äôt take advantage of these, they are an extremely nice add on to your guests and once again set you apart from other hotels in the area! Finally one thing to note in regards to the hotel itself (which, admittedly right now is impossible to avoid basically anywhere in Malta) was the building work. Again, this unfortunately is out of the control of the hotel but do note that the builders are right outside the hotel and start work very early until late evening. It is also outside the spa therefore noise is unavoidable. It is a real shame in respect of noise however it doesn‚Äôt affect the building itself and is necessary. The beach club, despite the few negative comments is once again a great addition. The sea view is unmatched and the staff were fantastic. The bar is also great and the restaurant was unexpectedly amazing, great portion sizes and really good food (the ribs are a must have!) It opens at 09:30am, and yes, if you want the most ideal beds, I would most definitely arrive prior to 10:30. The only real downfall of this is the fact that there is no age limit. Allowing children to dive into the water / use scuba goggles etc in the pool seems extremely distracting for people wanting a relaxing pool day. It was also very frustrating having the umbrellas up as it‚Äôs impossible to sunbathe in the pool when busy and they practically cover all the beds. I would bare this in mind if your main aim is to sunbathe for a tan. Finally, we can‚Äôt leave a review without mentioning the fantastic transport service we were grateful to the hotel for arranging for us throughout our stay. Franklin Garage is a family run taxi service used by the hotel and without a doubt a great company. The ease of being able to book through the hotel and charge to the room or use WhatsApp made it extremely easy and better than using any apps. They were always prompt on arrival and John/Lucienne were so lovely. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate recommending them to everyone for their transport needs in Malta! Thankyou! Overall, I would most definitely book to stay at 1926 and I‚Äôm so glad we chose this hotel after searching through many others. If you‚Äôre looking for a stylish, local, boutique hotel with amazing staff and facilities - this is your place!",

      "text": "Very comfortable city and beach hotel. I stayed in the junior suite and the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The cleaning team was excellent. My room was cleaned every day and also at the end of the day the bed would be made again. The check in and the check out was very efficient and the staff was friendly.I  just loved the swimming pool, which is a few minutes walk from hotel, just by the sea. They have a beautiful infinity pool which was not overly busy for July. I always managed to get sun loungers by the pool. There is a restaurant and bar by the pool and their food was very good.The spa was was very relaxing with a big jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and some heated chairs that helped to ease my back pain!The breakfast was plentiful with good coffee and fresh orange juice.I would stay in this hotel again and I would recommend it.",

      "text": "There were a lot of issues with our stay, in my opinion the hotel and its facilities are far too small for the amount of guests. The beach club is actually a ‚Äúcomplimentary service and runs on a first come first served basis‚Äù and is technically not part of the hotel. Most days it was completely full at 10:00am. You have to get in a queue at 09:30am for a sun-bed or you won‚Äôt get one, not how I wanted to be spending my holiday mornings and not something I‚Äôve ever had to do before. It makes you feel as though you have to rush around in the morning to ensure you have a sun-bed for the day. Our room was nice, a good size but on the first floor and over the reception. It was extremely noisy day and night. One night there were 15-20 people checking in at 22:00 when we were trying to sleep. The breakfast room is like a cattle market very busy and very small even when we tried to go at ‚Äúoff-peak‚Äù times. Having said this the manager Patricia went out of her way to sort out our issues, she went above and beyond to rectify our problems and she was the only reason we didn‚Äôt leave the hotel. We were upgraded to a different room and she even reserved sun-beds for us during our stay. Patrica is fantastic they are very lucky to have her working there. All of the reception and beach club staff were very kind and friendly and tried to help us when they could. I feel the arrangement of the beach club and hotel is very bizarre and doesn't work for hotel guests who want to relax and have a chilled holiday. It seemed to be very busy in all areas with not enough space for all guests.",

      "text": "The good bit: Great facilities, nice decor, good breakfast selection, an abundance of polite and friendly staff, good location for beach and shops. Resonably priced bar. The stay even included free of charge bus trips to different attractions on the island. (Take some cash for the Mdina/ Blue cave boat ride). The bad bits: Building work. Seven days a week. If you like a lie in, forget it. Hammering from 6:30 - 7:30am onwards, until afternoon ( afternoon siesta not possible due to noise). From our room on the ninth floor, we over looked a building site / crane. It took me a day or two to realise that the loudest construction noise was actually above us, on the tenth floor. Debris fell onto our balcony throughout. Therefore, the balcony was unusable. The cleaners, who did a great job on the room, neglected to sweep / clean any balconies that I could see. Also, to get into your room you have to input a four digit code on a display panel. On 3 separate occasions we could not access our room, as the code failed to open the door. A member of staff on reception was adamant that we were actually in a room on the third floor, and not the ninth! (His computer said so). Keyless entry is a good idea in theory but it caused us unnecessary grief and we ended up demanding a physical key. Be careful with the final bill. We always pay as we go. When checking out, we were told we owed for two drinks. Thankfully we were able to produce online banking receipts.",

She was extremely friendly, hospital, and proactive. She even helped us to plan ahead for a pre-scheduled return transfer back from our day trip, as well as a hotel to airport departure. We appreciated her loyalty, company and awesome local  recommendations! We know both 1926 and Franklin Garage is lucky to have her!",
